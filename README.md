**Project Description**
StakeLab is a multi-chain staking infrastructure provider and a non-custodial staking platform. We empower end users to manage both staked and non-staked assets while providing visibility across their entire portfolio, spanning over 80+ blockchains. Users can generate rewards through staking and utilize these rewards to diversify their portfolio into new assets. StakeLab also offers on/off-ramp services and is working towards implementing cross-chain transactions between different chains and assets.

**Goals**
- Enable Avalanche users to stake their AVAX both natively and via liquid staking options.
- Provide users with the ability to view their asset balances across all supported blockchains.
- Facilitate on/off-ramping of AVAX tokens.
- Facilitate swaps to/in Avalanche ecosystem.

**Use Cases**
We believe Avalanche staking requires increased visibility from other ecosystems. Our community (Cosmos France, 1.5k members) originated from the Cosmos ecosystem, and we see an excellent opportunity for cross-ecosystem growth. By enabling users to generate rewards and diversify their portfolios, we can significantly contribute to the evolution of the Avalanche ecosystem beyond its current boundaries.

With IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) integration becoming imminent through the launch of Landscape, we believe this is the ideal time to capitalize on increased visibility and utility for the Avalanche network.

**For the Avalanche Ecosystem**
- Enhanced visibility from external ecosystems.
- A dedicated staking hub for all $AVAX and Avalanche ecosystem-related staking activities.
- Greater yield opportunities and portfolio visibility for users.
- New pathways for onboarding users from other ecosystems and converting them into $AVAX holders.
- Expanded use cases for $AVAX, including conversion into fiat currency.

**Roadmap**
- Integration of Avalanche support.
- Connect to Avalanche-compatible wallets.
- Display balances for $AVAX and liquid staked derivatives.
- Implement all staking features and provide full visibility of user positions.
- Enable on/off-ramping of Avalanche tokens.
- Support cross-chain swaps, allowing users to convert rewards from other ecosystems into $AVAX, fiat, or stablecoins.

**Budget**
We are requesting $100,000 to support the development costs outlined in the roadmap.

**Team**
Our team comprises experienced engineers (DevOps, full-stack developers) and designers who have worked on various high-profile crypto projects, such as Ledger, WalletConnect, Shares, and CTRL Wallet.
